Overview: This 2d game is called "Coin Adventure", where you avoid the obstacles while collecting as many coins as you can. 

How to Interact:
- Press the space bar to start the game
- Press the space bar to make the player jump, avoid the obstacles, and collect the coins
- Press 'r' to restart after the game ends

Design and Research Process: For this project, a lot of my sources came from the Processing website, as well as many online sources. I ran into various challenges, which included the ground and background not connecting while moving, the player moving very slowly when jumping up and down, and putting the image for the coin. I overcame these challenges by experimenting and repeating with different methods until it worked. For example, for the player moving very slowly, I just had to take time and put in different numbers to see what worked the best. In terms of the page, I noticed that my restart key wasn't working, so I added a restart button instead. Also, my coin image was very small, but  I eventually figured out how to change the size of the coin image after multiple attempts.
