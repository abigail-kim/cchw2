Overview: This 2d game is called "Coin Adventure", where you avoid the obstacles while collecting as many coins as you can. 

How to Interact:
- Press the space bar to start the game
- Press the space bar to make the player jump and avoid the obstacles
- Press 'r' to restart after the game ended

Design and Research Process: For this project, a lot of my sources came from the Processing website, as well as many online sources such as Youtube and other websites. I did ran into various challenges, which included the ground and background not connecting while moving, the player moving very slowly when jumping up and down, and putting the image for the coin. I overcame these challenges by using the sources and experimenting, and repeating with different codes until it worked. For example, for the player moving very slowly, I just had to take time and put in different numbers to see what worked the best. In terms of the page, I noticed that my game was feeling really fast, and the restart key wasn't working. So I had to change that and make the game slower than before and added a restart button instead.
